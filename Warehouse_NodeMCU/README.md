# IoT-Based-Smart-Warehouse-Management-System

## Open Arduino IDE,
#### Go to File -> Preferences -> add <a href="https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json">https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</a> in Additional Boards Manager URLs and click OK

## Locate Documents folder in your PC (This is where all the code and libraries are stored by default),
#### Documents -> Arduino -> libraries -> add all the libraries used for the code from <a href="https://github.com/yathin017/IoT-Based-Smart-Warehouse-Management-System/tree/main/Warehouse_NodeMCU/Libraries_Used">Libraries_Used</a>
